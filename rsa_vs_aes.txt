RSA needs more computing energy especially for big files.
AES is faster and more efficient for encrypting any size files
RSA has limits when it comes to file size

RSA is used mostly for key exchange, small data encryption
AES is used for example to encrypt SSD, flash drive and etc. (using veracrypt for example)
